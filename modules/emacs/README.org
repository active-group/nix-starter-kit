* Emacs

To use this module, add it to your =additionalModules= in =user-settings.nix=:

#+begin_src nix
additionalModules = settings: [
  (import ./emacs settings)
]
#+end_src

Then use ~home-manager switch~ to install Emacs on your system.

To make use of some common configuration that we've written, execute the
following code in a shell to create a reasonable starting point:

#+begin_src shell
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d
cp -L ~/.config/ag-emacs/example-init.el ~/.emacs.d/init.el
chmod 600 ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+end_src

** Adding packages

We use =nixpkgs= to manage the packages Emacs comes equipped with. If you need
additional packages, use the =additionalEmacsPackages= attribute in
=user-settings.nix=.

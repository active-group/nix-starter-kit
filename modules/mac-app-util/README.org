* mac-app-util

This makes wrapper Mac applications available in

=~/Applications/Home Manager Trampolines=

From there, they show up in Spotlight and can be dragged into the dock.

(Nix installs into =~/.nix-profile/Applications=, which is a symlink into the Nix
store, and thus not stable thru version updates.)

If the trampoline crashes, try deleting =~/Applications/Home Manager Trampolines=
and run =home-manager switch= again.

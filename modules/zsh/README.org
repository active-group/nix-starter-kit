# zsh

Especially on macOS it might be useful to configure its default shell, =zsh=, to
work well with Nix and maybe dispatch to the easier-to-use-by-default shell =fish=
when used interactively.

(NOTE: if you have an existing =~/.zshrc= file that you wish to keep, don't do the
following; I trust that you should know what you're doing already in this case.)

Install our example =zsh= configuration file:

#+begin_src shell
cp ~/.config/home-manager/zsh/example-zshrc ~/.zshrc
#+end_src

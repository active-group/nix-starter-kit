* mac-app-util

This makes wrapper Mac applications available in

=~/Applications/Home Manager Trampolines=

From there, they show up in Spotlight and can be dragged into the
dock.

(Nix installs into =~/.nix-profile/Applications=, which is a symlink
into the Nix store, and thus not stable thru version updates.)
